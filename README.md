# g-LAW - Go(Lang) League API Wrapper

Wanted to make a simple wrapper to avoid making those weird urls RIOT wants.

*Note:* I have no idea what I'm doing in go; please take all this with a grain
of salt. If you have a suggestion please feel free to open a PR and explain
why you're making a change. I'll greatly appreciate it.
